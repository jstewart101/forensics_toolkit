1. #### FTK Imager
    * **Description:** This tool can be used to gather images from machines involved in the investigation. It is made by Access Data and is a Windows based software. You can download the executable from the link below and run as administrator to collect an image.  
    * **Review:** I found this tool fairly easy to use and there is a lot of documention on it. I would highly recommend it if you need to take an image of a computer. It can be used to take a full image or just a memory dump.
